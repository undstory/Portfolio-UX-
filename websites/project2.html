              I learned that even a small design change can have a huge impact on the user experience. The most important takeaway for me is to always focus on the real needs of the user when coming up with design ideas and solutions. I also learned that I don't have to be afraid of usability studies and participants' opinions about my project - it all brings my project closer to success.
