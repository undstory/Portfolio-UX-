          Paper wireframes:

            Taking the time to draft iterations of each screen of the app on
            paper ensured that the elements that made it to digital wireframes
            would be well-suited to address user pain points. For the home
            screen, I prioritized a quick and easy ordering process to help
            users save time - the answer was the idea that the search engine
            should be large and visible.
