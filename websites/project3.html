                I noticed that our shelter has huge communication problems, some
                of the community would like to help but are unable to because
                they do not even know that such help is needed.

              <li>
                Overall, I distinguished two groups of people. The first group
                are people willing to help directly at the shelter, as
                volunteers. So far, these people have had problems with contact,
                they could not communicate with the shelter about the current
                needs, vacancies and schedules.
              </li>
              <li>
                The second group of users are people who would simply like to
                help the shelter in other ways, adoption, but also material or
                financial help would be at stake. These people also have not
                been able to find the necessary information about what is needed
                in our shelter so far.

            Taking the time to iterate each application screen on paper has ensured that the items that ended up in the digital wireframes were well suited to solving user problems. From the very beginning, I wanted the application had utility functions and was extremely easy to use for people of all ages and levels of advancement.
